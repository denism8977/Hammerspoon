For detailed information, visit [hammerspoon.org](https://hammerspoon.org).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

### System API Access

Hammerspoon provides access to a wide range of system APIs. You can use Lua scripts to manipulate:

- Windows
- Applications
- Filesystem
- Audio
- Screens
- Keyboard and mouse events
- Network

This extensive access allows you to create custom solutions tailored to your workflow.

### Extensible Through ‚ÄúSpoons‚Äù

Spoons are modular plugins that enhance Hammerspoon's functionality. You can use Spoons to:

- Launch applications
- Manage screen brightness
- Keep a clipboard history
- Implement Pomodoro timers
- Display clocks

This modularity allows you to add features as needed without cluttering your main configuration.

### Configurable Hotkeys

With Hammerspoon, you can bind any key combination to trigger scripts or actions. This feature enables you to streamline your workflow and execute commands quickly.

### Window Management

Efficient window management is crucial for productivity. Hammerspoon allows you to:

- Move and resize windows
- Tile windows for better organization

These features are ideal for users who work with multiple applications simultaneously.

### Accessibility and Automation

Hammerspoon can automate repetitive tasks, making your workflow smoother. You can create scripts that interact with various applications and system functions seamlessly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

2. Open Hammerspoon, and you will see its icon in the menu bar.

3. Create your `init.lua` configuration file in the `~/.hammerspoon/` directory. This file is where you will write your Lua scripts.

### Example Script

Here‚Äôs a simple example of a Lua script to get you started:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "alt"}, "H", function()
